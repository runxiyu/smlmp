# SMLMP configuration file
# 
# This file is expected to be at /etc/smlmp.conf. This example
# configuration file explains what the settings mean, and provides the
# defaults that are used on andrewy.org's mailing list system.
#
# Everything is treated as a string. Multiline is allowed, followup
# lines must be indented. Comments begin with "#" or ";".

[general]

# The address extension delimiter used for postfix sub-addressing. This
# should match the recipient_delimiter setting in your postfix main.cf.
# It must be a single non-alphanumeric character that's valid in email
# addresses.
recipient_delimiter = +

# This is simply the email address of the list server's administrator.
# When an exception is raised, it is caught by an outer handler, and the
# formatted exception is sent to the administrator. It is thus important
# to configure this correctly. Additionally, unsolicited mail directly
# to the list manager's address is bounced to the administrator, and the
# administrator's address may be displayed elsewhere in user-facing
# interfaces.
administrator = andrew@andrewyu.org

# The path to the list configuration database. Currently, only a sample
# database is supplied with this program. In the future, the database
# should be automatically generated through Web and command line
# interfaces, and wouldn't need to be edited manually.
database = /srv/smlmp/smlmp/db.json

# What is the Web root of the mailing list's public-facing HTTP server?
# (The HTTP server part of SMLMP is still under development.)
# Most people would run the sever behind reverse proxies, just make sure
# you set the user-facing URL root here.
web_root = https://lists.mail.andrewyu.org/

# What is the local part of the address that SMLMP handles? This is used
# to check the validity of incoming mail, and is used (with the
# "bounces" address extension) when sending mail, as the envelope from
# address, and the "Sender" header in list posts.

# What is the domain part of the email address that SMLMP handles?
domain = andrewyu.org

# What host and port should be used to connect to an SMTP server to send
# mail? Since it is only supported to run this program on the same
# system that runs the email server, the following defaults should
# suffice. Note that setting smtp_port to 0 means smtplib will use its
# default.
smtp_host = localhost
smtp_port = 0

# What is the address of the archiving system? When an email is
# processed on a list with archive=true, it will forwarded to this
# address for archiving. See the public-inbox section of the SMLMP
# README for suggestions on setting up public-inbox for archiving.
