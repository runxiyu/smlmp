Goals
-----

+ Forward bounces to the postmaster
+ Basic forwarding of incoming mail that match configured lists
+ Sender validation: Allow lists to configure if they accept emails from
  everyone, just list members, or just moderators
+ List-related headers
+ DMARC: Carefully track header changes, never touch message content
+ Archive tag sends it over to public-inbox
- Action addresses:
  example+unsubscribe@example.org, example+subscribe@example.org
- Check db.json.lock
- Web interface for subscribers (flask?)
- Allow emails to be put on a moderation queue, and allow moderators to
  interact with these emails.
- Anti-spam

Documentation Goals
-------------------
- Document how to set up .forward, postfix, etc
- Document how to set up public-inbox
