SMLMP - Simple Mailing List Management Program
==============================================

SMLMP is a simple mailing list management program designed to be used
with Postfix. It is written in the Python programming language, but is
currently incomplete and under development.

WARNING: This program is currently in pre-alpha development quality.
Do not use it in important production environments. It also hasn't got
any security audits.

Note to self
------------
Remember to delete origin/sqlite3.

Dependencies
------------
* dkimpy (python3-dkim on Debian)
* Python 3.10 or above
  This means that this program will not work on Debian 11 bullseye and
  lower. Upgrade your system.

Setup
-----
(This section is unfinished)
* Username running the MDA must be in full lowercase

Setup for public-inbox
----------------------
(This section is unfinished)

Implemented features
--------------------

* Forward bounces to the postmaster
* Basic forwarding of incoming mail that match configured lists
* Sender validation: Allow lists to configure if they accept emails from
  everyone, just list members, or just moderators
* List-related headers
* DMARC: Carefully track header changes, never touch message content
* Archive option sends things over to public-inbox

Untested features
-----------------
* Action addresses:
  example+unsubscribe@example.org, example+subscribe@example.org

Developing features
-------------------
None at the moment.

Future features
---------------
* Verify DMARC of incoming messages instead of DKIM
* Web interface for subscribers (flask?)
* Allow emails to be put on a moderation queue, and allow moderators to
  interact with these emails.
* Anti-spam
* Allow reading alternate configuration file via a command-line option

Bugs
----
* Database-related functions simply block if they cannot acquire the
  database's file lock. In case another process (other delivery agents,
  or perhaps the Web interface's backend) crashes (SIGKILL, segmentation
  fault, etc; SIGTERM shouldn't cause problems as I put the unlocking
  mechanism in a finally: clause) and leaves the lock there, all
  processes that are trying to read or write to the database would be
  blocked indefinitely.
