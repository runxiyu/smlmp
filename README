SMLMP - Simple Mailing List Management Program
==============================================

SMLMP is a simple mailing list management program designed to be used
with Postfix on the same system. It is written in the Python programming
language, but is currently incomplete and under development.

WARNING: This program is currently in pre-alpha development quality.
Do not use it in important production environments. It also hasn't got
any security audits.

Configuration requirements
--------------------------
TODO: Write this part in more detail.

Dependencies
------------
* dkimpy (python3-dkim on Debian)
* Python 3.10 or above
  This means that this program will not work on Debian 11 bullseye or
  older. Upgrade your system.

Implemented features
--------------------

* Forward bounces to the postmaster
* Basic forwarding of incoming mail that match configured lists
* Sender validation: Allow lists to configure if they accept emails from
  everyone, just list members, or just moderators
* List-related headers
* DMARC: Carefully track header changes, never touch message content
* Archive option sends things over to public-inbox

Untested features
-----------------
* Action addresses:
  example+unsubscribe@example.org, example+subscribe@example.org

Developing features
-------------------
None at the moment.

Future features
---------------
* Web interface for subscribers (flask?)
* Allow emails to be put on a moderation queue, and allow moderators to
  interact with these emails.
* Anti-spam
* Allow reading alternate configuration file via a command-line option

Bugs
----
* The flock is automatically released when the Python process that
  creates it dies. If the process dies in the middle of writing, it
  might leave a corrupted file, and since the lock is released we won't
  be able to detect that.
* Potential race condition when writing the database?
* We should verify the DMARC of incoming messages rather than DKIM,
  otherwise we would have no way to know whether our From address was
  actually spoofed. Do note that we must verify DKIM when using DMARC,
  as SPF won't align as when we send email out to other servers.
* Missing Input validation for the From address and other headers.

Resolvable limitations
----------------------
* Currently, the domain-part of all handled mailing lists must match the
  domain-part of the email address that smlmp directly handles. I don't
  think this is a protocol limitation, it's an artefact of how I pass
  around mailing list names.
