What is a Mail Delivery Agent?
==============================

The part of SMLMP that connects to Postfix is a mail delivery agent,
abbreviated as "MDA". Basically, it expects certain environment
variables as described below to be set. SMLMP's MDA expects the
following environment variables to be correctly set by Postfix when it 
is called.

LOCAL                   The local-part of the final recipient address.
DOMAIN                  The domain-part of the final recipient address.
			As a special requirement, this must also be the
			domain-part of all mailing list addresses due to
			a technical limitaiton.
ORIGINAL_RECIPIENT      The original recipient when Postfix is told to
			handle the message.
			Note that this does not include all original
			recipients, it just states the original
			recipient that "caused" Postfix to deliver it
			to our LOCAL.
SENDER                  The SMTP envelope sender, as opposed to the From
			or Sender header in the email content. This is
			used for bouncing.

These are not used by SMLMP as of the time of writing:

RECIPIENT*              Full final recipient address.
MAIL_CONFIG*            Usually just /etc/postfix.
EXTENSION*              The subaddressing extension of the final
			recipient address. We don't actually use this
			environment variable, we care about the
			subaddressing extension in ORIGINAL_RECIPIENT
			instead, which we would parse ourself.
			(For background information on what
			subaddressing is, consult the comment above the
			"recipient_delimiter" option in the example
			smlmp.conf.)

The "finial recipient address" is not standard terminology. Here it
refers to the primary address that SMLMP is in charge of, after postfix
handles all aliases and routing. Our MDA sits at the final recipient
address and processes messages sent to it.

Important: The MDA expects to receive the content of the message to
deliver on standard input.
